I study Computer Engineering in <a href="https://www.unina.it/" target="_blank" class="text-indigo-400 hover:underline">Federico II University of Naples</a>. 
Computer Engineering isn't just my major; it's my hobby and passion.

My journey has led me to work with various technologies, from high-level iOS app development at the <a href="https://www.developeracademy.unina.it/" target="_blank" class="text-indigo-400 hover:underline">Apple Developer Academy</a> to low-level autonomous driving systems with <a href="https://www.uninacorse.com/" target="_blank" class="text-indigo-400 hover:underline">UniNa Corse</a>, and multiple <a href="https://github.com/ad-oliviero?tab=repositories" class="text-indigo-400 hover:underline">personal projects</a>.

I enjoy bridging the gap between hardware and software, whether it's simulating physics engines or building embedded controllers from scratch.
