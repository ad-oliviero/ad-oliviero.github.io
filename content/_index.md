I study Computer Engineering at [Federico II University of Naples](https://www.unina.it/). 
Computer Engineering isn't just my major; it's my hobby and passion.

My journey has led me to work with various technologies, from high-level iOS app development at the [Apple Developer Academy](https://www.developeracademy.unina.it/) to low-level autonomous driving systems with [UniNa Corse](https://www.uninacorse.com/), and multiple [personal projects](https://github.com/ad-oliviero?tab=repositories).
